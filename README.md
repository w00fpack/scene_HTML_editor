Scene is a lightweight (about 60kB) WYSIWYG HTML editor that runs in your web browser.  It is beta quality that has to go through testing amongst different browsers.

# Installation
Just copy the scene_html_editor.html anywhere, and access it via your browser.  There are also builds in the Releases section for Linux, that add a menu entry for the program.

## Requirements

* Browser that is relatively new that supports Javascript

# Quickstart

1. Make HTML edits as wanted
2. The save button is being updated.  For now to save, check the view source checkbox, and copy/paste the source into a new text file (using Notepad, Leafpad, etc.)
